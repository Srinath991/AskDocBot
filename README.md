# Document Q&A System

## 📜 Project Overview
The Document Q&A System enables users to upload documents (PDF or text), ask questions related to the document, and receive AI-generated answers in real-time. This project utilizes Google Generative AI for natural language processing, Pinecone for scalable vector storage, and LangChain to integrate retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). The system features a sleek, chatbot-style UI that enhances user interaction, making it a powerful tool for document-based queries.

## 🌟 Key Features
- **Document Upload**: Users can upload PDF or text files for processing.
- **Real-Time Q&A**: Users can ask questions related to the uploaded documents and receive instant, AI-powered answers.
- **Google Generative AI**: Utilizes embedding-001 for document embeddings and language understanding.
- **Pinecone Integration**: Pinecone handles document embeddings and allows efficient similarity search.
- **Chatbot-style UI**: A modern and interactive user interface for seamless user experience.
- **Containerization**: The project is containerized using Docker for easy deployment.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Python, FastAPI, LangChain, Pinecone, Google Generative AI
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Interactive UI)
- **Database**: Pinecone (Vector database for search and retrieval)
- **Deployment**: Docker, AWS (Cloud deployment)
- **Others**: Uvicorn, Jinja2 templates for dynamic pages

Run Docker Container bash Copy code docker run -d -p 8000:8000 --env-file .env document-qa Access the Application Visit http://localhost:8000 in your browser. 🌐 Deploying on AWS Push the Docker image to Docker Hub: bash Copy code docker tag document-qa <your-dockerhub-username>/document-qa docker push <your-dockerhub-username>/document-qa Deploy on AWS ECS or Elastic Beanstalk: Use AWS ECS (Elastic Container Service) or Elastic Beanstalk to deploy the image, configure environment variables from the .env file, and run the container. 🔍 How the System Works Document Upload: The user uploads a document via the web interface (PDF or TXT format). The document is processed, and embeddings are created using Google Generative AI. Document Storage: Embeddings are stored in Pinecone, which enables fast similarity search. User Query: The user asks a question related to the document. The system retrieves relevant content from Pinecone and generates an answer using Google Generative AI. 📚 Use Cases Legal: Automate document review and question answering for contracts, laws, etc. Healthcare: Answer patient queries based on medical reports or research papers. Education: Provide personalized answers to students based on educational materials. 🙌 Contributors [Your Name] - Developer Contributions are welcome!
